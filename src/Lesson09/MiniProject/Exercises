Student Understanding Questions
Part 1 – Inheritance
1 What does it mean that Dog, Cat, and Lizard extend the Pet class?
2 Why do we use super(name); inside the constructor of Dog?
3 What would happen if we removed extends Pet from the Dog class?
4 Why can we store Dog, Cat, and Lizard objects inside a Pet[] array?
________________________________________
Part 2 – Encapsulation
5 Why is the variable name declared as private inside the Pet class?
6 Why must we use getName() instead of writing pet.name?
7 What is the purpose of a setter method like setName()?
________________________________________
Part 3 – Polymorphism
8 Why does System.out.println(pets[i]); print different text for Dog, Cat, and Lizard?
9 What is method overriding?
10 At runtime, how does Java decide which toString() method to call? (Dynamic method dispatch)
________________________________________
Part 4 – Arrays
11 What does pets.length represent?
12 Why do we write pets.length - 1 in the sorting loop?
13 What would happen if we tried to access pets[pets.length]?
________________________________________
Part 5 – Sorting
14 Why do we need two nested for-loops in the bubble sort method?
15 Why do we use a temporary variable (temp) when swapping two objects?
16 What does compareTo() return when the first name comes after the second name alphabetically?
________________________________________
Part 6 – Input Validation
17 Why do we use sc.hasNextInt() before calling nextInt()?
18 Why do we call sc.nextLine() after nextInt()?
19 Why is equalsIgnoreCase() better than equals() when checking pet type?
________________________________________
Part 7 – Structure & Design
20 Why is it good practice to divide the main method into smaller helper methods like askForPetCount() and registerPets()?


🐦 Assignment: Extend the PetAdoptionCenter with a Bird Class
Part 1 – Create the Bird Class
Requirements:
Create a new class called Bird. The class must inherit from Pet
Add a new private attribute:
    double wingSpan
Create:
A constructor
Getter and setter methods
Override the toString() method
    The toString() method should print:
        Name
        Wing span
A bird sound (for example: "chirp chirp!")

Part 2 – Modify the PetAdoptionCenter
You must update the program so that:
The user can type "bird" when registering a pet
The program asks:
    Enter wing span in meters:
A Bird object is created and stored in the Pet[] array

Part 3 – Validation
Make sure:
Wing span must be greater than 0
If the user enters invalid input, show a message and ask again.
A message could be: "Invalid number!"
