📚 STUDENT ASSIGNMENT
🪑 Furniture Management System (OOP)

You must build a small furniture management system. I have made a FurnitureTest class,
 but the other classes are missing.

🧪 Step 1 – REMOVE */ FROM FurnitureTest Class
Draw a class and flow diagram of the main method.

🧱 Step 2 – Create an Abstract Class: Furniture
Create an abstract class called Furniture
Add private attributes:
String name
double price
String material

Add:
Constructor
Getters and setters
toString() method

Add TWO abstract methods:
public abstract String getDescription();
public abstract double calculateShippingCost();

🧱 Step 3 – Create Subclasses
Create at least these classes:
Chair
Table
Sofa
Bed

Each class must:
Extend Furniture
Implement the abstract methods
Possibly add extra attributes (Chair: private boolean hasArmRest;
Table: private int numberOfLegs; Sofa: private int seats; Bed: private String size;)
